# solidworksPowerUp
This is a shared location to create the SolidWorks model

of our 2018 FRC robot.  Here we will have organized 
folders and files that will hold the Solidworks files 
for the 2018 FRC robot.

/*****  START HERE *****/
The fist thing we will do is make you a folder.
Be sure to understand what "Repositories, Branches, Pull Requests, and Commits mean.

From the WebSite GitHub.com:

//Create a folder with your name on it.
	
	Locate and click on the solidworksPowerUp repository.
	Click the "Create new file" button near the green clone button.

//You can't create folders, but you can create files in a new folder.
	
	In the space: "Name your file", type the following:
		"yourName" then add "Edits/yourNameREADME.md" to the end.
		Example: "sawyerEdits/sawyerREADME.md"
		
//Document Everything  COMMIT means your edit or change in the solidworksPowerUp directory
	
	Give your README file an explanation of your folder 
	and at the bottom in the "Commit new file" box give a brief explanation of your Commit
	and more description if necessary.
	
	Click the "Commit directly to the master branch" for your folder and README file.
	Click the "Commit new file" green button.
	

//You should now have a directory where you can edit your files and keep track of revisions.
