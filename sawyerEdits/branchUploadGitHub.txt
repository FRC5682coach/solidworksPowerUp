This is an exercise to see how uploaded files work with a branch other than the master 
and how to merge them with the master.

//Create a branch of the solidworksPowerUp
	Click on the dropdown of Branch:master in the yourNameEDITS folder.
	Type a descriptive name of the branch you want to create in the text field.
	Then hit Enter.
//Upload a file from your new branch.
	Have a file saved on your computer to upload to your branch.
		This file would be a good test.  
		Download this file for your exercise uploading it you yourNameEDITS folder.
	Click the "Upload files" near the right of the screen.
//Commit Changes
	Give brief description of your upload, 
	and expand on your description if necessary in the larger text field.
	Click the green "Commit changes" button.
//Merge your branch to the master branch.
	//Remember we should be in the branch you made for this exercise.
	//Your branch is a copy of the solidworksPowerUp repository,
	//Pull request looks at the master and yours and compares the differences.
	//This allows you to see what will be changed before you merge to the master branch.
	
	Go you yourNameEdits folder and check your upload.
	Click back on the solidworksPowerUp folder under your branch.
	Click the "Compare & pull request"
